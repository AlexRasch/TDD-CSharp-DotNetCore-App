# TDD-CSharp-DotNetCore-App

This GitHub repository houses a small test-driven application built using C# and .NET Core. As a junior developer's first venture into test-driven development (TDD), the repository serves as a learning platform and showcases the practical application of TDD principles. The project is organized into three main components: Tests, Domain, and Web API. The "Tests" folder contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests that verify the functionality and behavior of the application. The "Domain" folder encapsulates the core logic and business rules of the application. Finally, the "Web API" folder implements a RESTful API that serves as the interface for interacting with the application. Explore the code, gain insights into TDD practices, and join the journey of a junior developer's growth in software development.
